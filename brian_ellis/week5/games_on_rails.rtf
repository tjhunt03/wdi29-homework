\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Games on Rails\
\
Games on Rails is a web application with three games\
\
* Magic 8 Ball\
* Secret Number\
* Rock Paper Scissors\
\
__Magic 8 Ball__\
\
* Magic 8 ball takes user's questions from the the URL as params and returns a positive or negative answer.\
* You should make a route like ```/games/magic/:question``` which routes to ```magic#play``` (i.e. you will need a controller called ```magic_controller.rb```).\
\
__Secret Number__\
\
* Users click a number between 1 and 10. The controller validates the guess and renders the win or lose view.\
* You should make a route like ```/games/secret/:guess``` which routes to ```secret#play```\
__Rock Paper Scissors__\
\
* Create a route that goes from ```/games/rock_paper_scissors/:throw``` to ```rps#play```\
* Use params[:throw] as a user's choice\
* Compare the 2! If  users throw matches the apps throw, the user wins.\
* i.e. If a user throws rock ```http://localhost:3000/games/rock_paper_scissors/rock``` and the server picks rock player wins! (Yes,  I know that is not how RPS works)\
Bonus: Set the win or lose condition based on the real rules of [Rock Paper Scissors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors).}
